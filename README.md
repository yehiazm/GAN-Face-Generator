# GAN-Face-Generator
In this project, Generative Adersarial Networks (GAN) was used to implement a face generator using pyTorch. 
A preprocessed version of the Celebrities Dataset was provided by Udacity to be used in the project. To run this notebook, you need to download the celebrities dataset by [clicking here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/video.udacity-data.com/topher/2018/November/5be7eb6f_processed-celeba-small/processed-celeba-small.zip). Each of the CelebA images has been cropped to remove parts of the image that don't include a face, then resized down to 64x64x3 NumPy images. This project is one of the Deep Learning Nanodegree introduced by Udacity. https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101
